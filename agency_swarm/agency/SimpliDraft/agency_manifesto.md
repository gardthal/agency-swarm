# SimpliDraft Agency Manifesto

## Mission:
Automate and refine the workflow between drafting proposals and reviewing them, creating a seamless pipeline for high-quality and thoroughly reviewed proposals ready for submission.

## Agency Structure:
1. **CEO (Chief Execution Officer):** Primary communicator with the user, collecting input for drafting and conveying final approval after review.
2. **Proposal Drafter:** Dedicated to creating drafts based on guidelines and user input. Ensures the draft meets specific criteria and is prepared for review.
3. **Reviewer:** Responsible for scrutinizing the drafts, suggesting improvements, and finalizing the document for submission.

### Communication Flows:
```python
agency = Agency([
    ceo,  # CEO will be the entry point for communication with the user
    [ceo, proposal_drafter],  # CEO can initiate communication with Proposal Drafter
    [proposal_drafter, reviewer],  # Proposal Drafter can initiate communication with Reviewer
    [reviewer, ceo]  # Reviewer can initiate communication with CEO after reviewing
], shared_instructions='agency_manifesto.md')
```
